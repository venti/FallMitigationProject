The National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) is a CDC organization that conducts an extensive annual survey called the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS administers face-to-face interviews in a nationally representative sample of households. Each month a probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States is interviewed by personnel of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Information is obtained about the health and other characteristics of each member of the household. 
The NHIS contains many similar questions every year. The repeated items are called "core questions and are divided into three components -- Family, Sample Adult, and Sample Child. Supplemental questions and modules are added year over year. The NHIS data release consists of eight questionnaires, six core data files, a paradata file, a Family Disability Questions file, and a Functioning and Disability file. 
Questions about falls and injury due to falls have been included in the NHIS survey since 2004 and the data appears in the Injury and Poisoning Episode (InjPoE) dataset.  The NHIS releases the datasets in ASCII, SAS, SPSS, Stata and CSV formats. The CSV format is only available since 2015 and the remaining data formats require proprietary software to parse and analyze. The author has requested NHIS (via email sent on Mar 21, 2020) to release prior year datasets in the CSV format and is awaiting a reply.
